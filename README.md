## Hi there 👋

### 🤔 Who am I?
I'm an experienced Technical Lead and Senior Backend Engineer specialising in Java. I'm passionate about crafting high-quality architectural solutions while closely collaborating with the business. I find fulfilment in overcoming challenges and consistently delivering excellence in my work. Beyond this, I have a keen interest in diversity, equality, and creating a supportive atmosphere in the workplace.

### 💻 What can you find here?

You can see I'm not very active here, as I'm very busy in my day to day work, but I'm planning to add some playground projects here to keep it a bit more interested. I'm interested in new technologies, in AI and ML and in general, in everything that can make my work easier in the future.
