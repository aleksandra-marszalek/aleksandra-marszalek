## Hi there 👋

### 🤔 Who am I?

I'm an experienced Technical Lead and Senior Backend Engineer specializing in Java. My passion lies in crafting high-quality architectural solutions while fostering close collaboration with the business. I find fulfillment in overcoming challenges and consistently delivering excellence in my work. 
Beyond this, I'm deeply interested in promoting diversity, equality, and creating a supportive workplace atmosphere.

🏅 In my free time, I am an accomplished ultimate frisbee player, having represented both Great Britain and Poland internationally on numerous occasions. 
📖🌴 I'm also an avid reader, enjoy watching films, exploring new places, and extend my passion for helping others by mentoring individuals seeking their first job in IT.

### 💻 What will you find here?

While I'm not as active on GitHub due to my busy day-to-day work, I'm planning to add some intriguing playground projects to keep things interesting. My curiosity extends to new technologies, AI, and ML. I'm fascinated by anything that can streamline and enhance my work in the future.
